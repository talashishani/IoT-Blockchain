# IoT-Blockchain

A system is proposed to integrate blockchain technology into an IoT ecosystem in order to deal with big data generated by sensors and devices. 
Integration of blockchain technology in IoT is useful for data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, authentication, preserving confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Blockchain grants devices independence, since IoT devices do not exist as independent entities outside of their centrally managed networks.
On a blockchain network, each node has a unique private and public key pair that uniquely identifies it as an independent participant on the network. Specifically, these identities are enforced largely using cryptographic signatures, or digital messages that unmistakably identify the sender, hence, each node will be able to make its own decisions, and, more importantly, to make use of its own resources independently of the other nodes.
This type of networks is much more secure, since a single point of failure will be removed.
